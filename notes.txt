THIS IS JUST RANDOM NOTES TO HELP BE UNDERSTAND WHAT IM ABOUT TO WRITE IN CODE

things that need to be done
1. write better read me
2. make it so you can run the detection without being connected to the arduino
3. clean up the 'int main' function



vglrun ./my-recognition --network=coco-bottle --input-flip=rotate-180 csi://0
vglrun ./my-recognition --input-flip=rotate-180 --network=coco-bottle --input-width=1280 --input-height=720 csi://0




Width and heigh
	W=1280 H=720



first we need to find out how much we need to turn then 
how fast we need to go to get there
	if too close then we get speed of 0
findClosest just finds  the closest one so that we work with the right one and not one in the distance.

This is all in driveRobot

get x1 and x2 coors 
x2 - x1 = distance between them 
distance between them / 2 = midpoint of picture

X1 + midpoint of picture = where the midpoint of 
the box is on the large picture.

first check if position of midpointofpic is in the middle of the picture > 600 and < 680
	if it is then go straight 
if it is on the left side stop left wheel 
	
if it is on the right side stop right wheel
after doing that it needs to check if it is close enough 
	if "distance between them" > 900 them stop	
else full speed
