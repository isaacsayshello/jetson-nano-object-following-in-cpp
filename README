This code is for the jetson nano. Basically what it does is allow the jetson nano to follow an object around. 
It is currently relatively stable, but it needs some work done to it to make it easily usable by other people. I am currently working on that.

I decided to make this because there was no object following program for the jetson nano that was written in c++.

It works without having motors or arduino connected as far as know.
Ive found that using virtualGl to run the program works the best if you want to see the camera feed. It has a much higher fps than using something like vnc or rdp.

I would HIGHLY recomend working through the 'jetson-inference' tutorials on github by dusty-nv/nivida before even thinking about messing around with this. 
Also this relies on the libarys that are installed when you compile and install the jetson-inference nativly.

Im working making step by step instructions but for now this is the general method.

1. first compile and install the jetson-inference
2. download this project
3. try to compile it
	3a. cmake . 
4. if/when it fails then install the libarys that are missing.
5. when cmake works you can then compile it.
	5a. make -j5
6. if it compiled fine then you will be able to see the executable.
7. to start it you just run the sh file which has the whole long command in it instead of typing it all by hand.
	7a. bash startFollowing.sh
